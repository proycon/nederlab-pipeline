# Nederlab Pipeline

This repository contains the NLP pipeline for the linguistic enrichment of
historical dutch, as developed in the scope of the [Nederlab
project](https://www.nederlab.nl/). This repository covers only the pipeline
logic, powered by [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), not the individual components.

## Installation

The pipeline and all components on which it depends is shipped as a part of [LaMachine](https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine).

## Usage

Inside LaMachine, you can invoke the workflow as follows:

```
$ nederlab.nf
```

For instructions, run ``nederlab.nf --help``.
